                            <p>Like any new vehicle, buying a new cart from a dealer is likely to expose you to healthy depreciation in year 1. However, <strong>pre-owned golf carts are very economical</strong> if you look at their per year cost of ownership.</p>
                            <p>Top manufacturers don't change body styles and features often meaning slow linear depreciation curves. If you purchase a pre-owned cart and keep it for a few years, our experience has been that <strong>it will cost you around a dollar a day, including depreciation</strong>, if well maintained.</p>

                            <p>There aren't nearly as many things to break on a cart vs a car, so there aren't a lot of repairs involved in carts that are top-tier brands, properly maintained, and less than 15 years old.</p>
                            <p>Maintenance costs are fairly low as well, as long as you keep lead acid batteries topped off and charged. Worried about this? Talk to us about lithium ion batteries... they are a gamechanger.</p>

                                <h4>⚠️ IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNING</h4>
                                <p><strong>You need to understand the dangers of lift kits.</strong> They lift the center of gravity of the cart and make it less stable and more likely to flip - especially if driven aggressively or by an inexperienced driver. The taller the lift, the higher the risk of flipping when cornering.</p>
                                <p><strong>Lithium batteries in combination with a lift kit introduces even more risk</strong> because you are reducing weight in the bottom of the cart. All of these things need to be considered when making your decision to lift or not, and how high.</p>
                            </div>

                            <p>Typical lift kits are available in sizes from 2" to 6" with the higher number creating a higher stance. Customers often opt to put larger tires on their cart for visual reasons, and depending on the desired tire size, a lift might be needed.</p>

                                    <p>The wheel wells must have sufficient clearance for driving and cornering. When wheels are turned fully, wider tires can rub if not sized correctly. Load must be considered because the cart sits lower with more weight, especially in back with a backseat.</p>
